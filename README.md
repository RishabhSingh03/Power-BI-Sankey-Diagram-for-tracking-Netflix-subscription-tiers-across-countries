# Power-BI-Sankey-Diagram-for-tracking-Netflix-subscription-tiers-across-countries
The Sankey diagram is a powerful tool for showcasing the flow of a population. This graphic is particularly challenging to make with traditional coding methods, so utilizing a tool such as PowerBI greatly simplified my effort. While significant data wrangling is required to build out the proper data model, the program easily generates the Sankey chart.

This project shows how initial contacts may become subscribers without using a trial period using PowerBI DAX skills. It required me to unpivot data, create dynamic models, and format data to generate the desired graphic. I conducted the intial data cleaning using python. The code is attached

The skills used here are:

Data wrangling
PowerBI DAX functions
PowerBI data modeling
Generating Sankey charts
